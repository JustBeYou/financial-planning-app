# Project Configuration and Development Rules

Ignore .cursorrules and README.md files.

## Environment

* Use **Node.js v22**.
* Select Node version via **nvm** (`.nvmrc` should specify `22`).
* Use **TypeScript v5**.
* Avoid modifying `.env` files unless explicitly specified.

## Framework and Libraries

* Use **Next.js v15**.
* Use **React v19**.
* Use **Tailwind CSS v4**.
* Use **Drizzle** and **drizzle-orm** for database access.
* Use **SQLite** as the database engine.
* Use **tRPC v11** for type-safe API communication.
* Use **Zod v3** for runtime validation.

## Tooling

* Use **Biome** for linting and formatting.

## Code Organization

* Keep all code **modular and DRY**. Avoid duplication across components, utilities, and business logic.
* Group related functionality by domain. Follow feature-first or domain-driven folder structure.
* Use absolute imports to simplify navigation and refactoring.

## Testing

* Write **unit and integration tests** for every functionality.
* Cover both **frontend and backend** logic.
* Use **Jest** for unit testing.
* Use **Playwright** for end-to-end (E2E) testing.
* Maintain high code coverage, but prioritize meaningful test scenarios.

## Documentation

* Use **docblocks** (`/** */`) to document functions, types, and modules.
* Avoid unnecessary inline comments.
* Consult specifications in `specs/` when implementing or modifying features.

## Additional Suggestions

* Prefer server components in Next.js where performance is improved.
* Use environment variables for sensitive or environment-specific values.
* Validate inputs at the API layer using **Zod** schemas shared with the client.
* Auto-generate API and database types where applicable.
* Keep a changelog or follow conventional commits for traceability.

## Enforcement

These rules are to be followed by all team members and enforced via tooling and peer review to ensure consistency and maintainability.
