# Code Organization

- Keep code modular and DRY
- Group functionality by domain (feature-first/domain-driven)
- Use absolute imports with `~/` alias
- Check for existing code before adding new features
- Split UI components into:
  - Smart components (business logic, API fetching)
  - Dumb components (UI only, props-based)
- Keep files under 500 lines
- Directory structure:
  - `src/app`: Public frontend
  - `src/app/components`: Reusable components
  - `src/server`: Backend
  - `src/lib`: Shared business logic
