# Best Practices

- Prefer server components in Next.js for better performance
- Use environment variables for sensitive/configuration values
- Validate inputs at API layer using Zod schemas
- Auto-generate API and database types where possible
- Keep a changelog or follow conventional commits
- Enforce rules via tooling and peer review
